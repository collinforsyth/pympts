# Pympts

A native python library for dealing with MPEG transport streams.

Pronounced _PIMTs_

## About

This is based off of the ISO/IEC 13818-1 International Standard. Pympts is meant to be first and foremost a highly functional _and_ usable native Python library for interacting with MPEG transport streams, speed will be an afterthought. The idea is to have a [MediaInfo](https://github.com/MediaArea/MediaInfo) interface for Python. The use is aimed for developers that are building ad-hoc scripts to explore Transport Streams.

## Standards Compliance

This is currently just tested by making some ts files from random mp4 clips and `ffmpeg`. It is relatively high on the TODO list to test against the ISO/IEC 13818-1 standard.
